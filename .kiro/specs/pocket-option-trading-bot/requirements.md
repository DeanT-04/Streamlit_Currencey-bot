# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a sophisticated automated trading bot for the Pocket Option platform. The bot will enable users to execute automated trades on currency pairs using technical indicators (RSI + SMA crossover strategy), with a target success rate of 80% or better. The system features a Streamlit-based web interface for monitoring and control, multi-API integration for signal validation, and comprehensive risk management through demo mode operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Integration and Data Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to integrate with multiple APIs to fetch real-time market data and execute trades, so that I can make informed trading decisions based on validated signals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL establish connections to Pocket Option API, Alpha Vantage API, and Telegram API
2. WHEN requesting market data THEN the system SHALL fetch candlestick data for the specified currency pair and timeframe
3. WHEN placing a trade THEN the system SHALL execute call/put orders through the Pocket Option API
4. IF an API call fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL throttle requests to stay within quotas
6. WHEN storing API credentials THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for secure storage

### Requirement 2: Trading Strategy Engine

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to analyze market data using technical indicators and generate buy/sell signals, so that I can automate my trading strategy with consistent execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing market data THEN the system SHALL calculate RSI (Relative Strength Index) values
2. WHEN analyzing market data THEN the system SHALL calculate SMA (Simple Moving Average) values
3. WHEN RSI < 30 AND price > SMA THEN the system SHALL generate a BUY (call) signal
4. WHEN RSI > 70 AND price < SMA THEN the system SHALL generate a SELL (put) signal
5. WHEN a signal is generated THEN the system SHALL validate it against Alpha Vantage data
6. WHEN executing trades THEN the system SHALL use 1-minute timeframes with 60-second expiration by default
7. WHEN backtesting THEN the system SHALL simulate 10 trades and aim for 80% win rate

### Requirement 3: Streamlit Web Interface

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a web-based dashboard to monitor my bot's performance and control its operations, so that I can easily manage my automated trading without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time trading signals and market data
2. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the system SHALL show current balance, trade history, and win/loss statistics
3. WHEN using controls THEN the system SHALL allow users to start/stop the bot, select currency pairs, and set trade amounts
4. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL show candlestick data with RSI and SMA overlays
5. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL allow toggling between demo and real trading modes
6. WHEN customizing the interface THEN the system SHALL provide theme options and layout configurations
7. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow users to download trade logs and performance reports

### Requirement 4: Risk Management and Security

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to operate safely with proper risk controls and security measures, so that I can protect my capital and sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot initializes THEN the system SHALL start in demo mode by default
2. WHEN switching to real trading THEN the system SHALL require explicit user confirmation
3. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt API keys and credentials
4. WHEN detecting unusual market conditions THEN the system SHALL pause trading and alert the user
5. WHEN trade amounts exceed configured limits THEN the system SHALL reject the trade and log the event
6. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures

### Requirement 5: Notification and Communication

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive timely notifications about my bot's activities and performance, so that I can stay informed even when not actively monitoring the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trade is executed THEN the system SHALL send a Telegram notification with trade details
2. WHEN the bot generates a signal THEN the system SHALL notify the user via Telegram
3. WHEN balance changes occur THEN the system SHALL send balance update notifications
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send alert notifications to the user
5. WHEN the bot stops unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL send an emergency notification
6. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL include relevant context (pair, amount, reason)

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to operate reliably with consistent performance, so that I can trust it to execute my trading strategy without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing signals THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 5 seconds
2. WHEN handling concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL support up to 100 trades per day
3. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL implement graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs at INFO and ERROR levels
5. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL maintain 99% uptime during trading hours
6. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup routines to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage to ensure the bot operates correctly and reliably, so that users can trust the system's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL achieve 80% or higher code coverage
2. WHEN testing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use Playwright for end-to-end testing
3. WHEN testing API integrations THEN the system SHALL include mock responses for offline testing
4. WHEN testing trading logic THEN the system SHALL include backtesting scenarios with historical data
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL validate error handling and edge cases
6. WHEN deploying code THEN the system SHALL pass all automated tests before release

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want clear documentation and well-structured code, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL include concise, meaningful comments for all major functions
2. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide feature-specific guides with examples
3. WHEN setting up the system THEN the system SHALL include clear installation and configuration instructions
4. WHEN maintaining code THEN the system SHALL follow PEP8 standards and use type hints
5. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL maintain modular structure with files under 300 lines
6. WHEN committing changes THEN the system SHALL use proper version control practices with atomic commits
